# ccp-recipes

AutoPkg recipes for Creative Cloud Packager workflows. This repo has now been moved to [autopkg/adobe-ccp-recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/adobe-ccp-recipes), so any further development will happen there.

Recipe identifiers have not changed, so if you were already tracking this repo with Git, one simple way to migrate your repo to the new remote location would be to go to your AutoPkg recipe repo dir (most likely `~/Library/AutoPkg/RecipeRepos/com.github.mosen.ccp-recipes`) and modify the `.git/config` to use the new repo location of https://github.com/autopkg/adobe-ccp-recipes.
